# UVa Competitive Programming Tracker

## Work in progress

UVaCPTracker is a chrome extension that makes easier to keep track of how many
problems of the [Competitive Programming](http://cpbook.net/) a user has
already solved.

This extension uses the [uhunt api](http://uhunt.felix-halim.net/api) to get
the data, but is not related to UVa or Uhunt anyhow.
